## Getting Started
This game is written in JavaScript with some ES6 feature used, so you only need a modern browser that supports ES6 to play the game! Check if your browser support ES6: ECMAScript 6 compatibility table

## Game Rule
Each level will have different set(s) of button blinking and the player must follow the blinking pattern and click on the corresponding button in the exact same order. If the player manages to click the buttons in order, they progress to the next level and face a more complex set of challenge.
